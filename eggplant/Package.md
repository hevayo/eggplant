Eggplant Compiler Plugin

# Package Overview
This package contains the Eggplant dataflow graph analyzer compiler plugin. It is used to analyze the worker-based dataflow graph of a program and generate a report of the results.

This plugin creates a file named "dataflow_graph.dot" in the package root directory. This file can be used to generate a graphical representation of the dataflow graph using the Graphviz dot tool.
